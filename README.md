- Worked with ClamAV version `0.103.3+dfsg-0+deb11u1`. Didn't test with newer ClamAV's versions
- Didn't test on Windows platform
- This is the binding of https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/main/libclamav/clamav.h. Some functions don't have binding (like `cl_hash_file_fd_ctx`). It's because of missing structs and i'm too lazy to add them.
- Some important functions of ClamAV are in https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/main/libclamav/others.h. They are not in this binding lib.
- Example can be found at https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/main/examples/ex1.c. To enable options of ClamAV, `bitops` must be called
- Requires:
    - compile time: `libclamav-dev`
    - runtime: `libclamav9`
